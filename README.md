# What is Stellar for?

The Stellar network launched in 2014. Since then it’s processed more than 2 billion operations made by over 6.5 million individual accounts. Large enterprise companies and companies as small as single-dev startups have chosen Stellar to move money and access new markets.

From the beginning, Stellar has been cryptocurrency-adjacent, but the software has always been intended to enhance rather than supplant the existing financial system. Whereas the Bitcoin network was made for trading only bitcoins, Stellar is a decentralized system that’s great for trading any kind of value in a transparent and efficient way. 

The Stellar network has a native digital currency, the lumen, which is required in small amounts for initializing accounts and making transactions. But beyond those requirements, Stellar doesn’t privilege any particular currency. It’s specifically designed to make traditional forms of value more useful and accessible in the digital realm.

For example, here’s what you can do with Stellar. You can create a digital representation of a U.S. dollar, or a “dollar token,” and tell the world that whenever someone deposits a traditional dollar with you, you’ll issue them one of your new tokens. When someone brings that “dollar token” back to you, you promise to redeem it in turn for one of the regular dollars in that deposit account. You’ve set up a 1:1 relationship between your digital token and a traditional dollar. Every one of your tokens out in the world is backed by an equivalent deposit. So while people hold the tokens, they can treat them just like traditional money, because they know that they’re exchangeable for traditional money in the end.
