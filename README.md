Stellar is an open-source, decentralized protocol that enables the transfer of digital currencies and assets. It was founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a co-founder of Ripple, with the goal of facilitating cross-border transactions and making financial services more accessible to everyone, especially in areas where traditional banking systems are limited.

The native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network is called Lumens (XLM). Lumens serve as a bridge asset that helps facilitate multi-currency transactions and acts as a unit of digital value to support fast and low-cost transactions on the network.

Assets on the Stellar network are represented as tokens. These tokens can represent various things, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, real estate, and even other assets like loyalty points or game credits. These tokens are issued by entities on the Stellar network and can be traded, transferred, and exchanged within the ecosystem.

One of the key features of Stellar is its ability to facilitate quick and affordable cross-border transactions. The network uses a consensus algorithm called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which allows for fast transaction confirmations (usually within a few seconds) while maintaining security and decentralization.

Additionally, Stellar has a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables users to trade between different assets issued on the network. This DEX facilitates the conversion of assets during transactions, making it easier for users to access different currencies or assets without relying on traditional exchanges.

Overall, Stellar aims to make financial transactions more efficient, affordable, and accessible to a wide range of users, including individuals, businesses, and financial institutions, particularly in areas with limited access to traditional banking services.
